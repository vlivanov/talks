# Conclusion #1: We don't pay enough attention to the security.

# Quality

# Twitter App

* Newsfeed still lags on Samsung S9
* 8 cores are still not enough for twitter for smooth scroll!

---

# Conclusion #2: Our apps are unstable, slow, creepy looking, lack functionality or become incredibly complex.

---

# Inclusion 

---

![fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJjv_OeiHmo)

---

# If you lack diversity in your product teams, you're unable to build proper products

---

# Terms

* Inclusivity - ability of a group to include different people
* Diversity - property of a group including different people

---

# Gender diversity

* Because it affects everybody.
* It's not about social justice, wage gap, etc.

---

# Some stats

* Women occupy __7%__ of programming jobs in Russia, __20%__ in USA[^5]
* Stackoverflow.com audience is only __9%__ women [^6]

# More stats...


One large-scale study found that after about 12 years, approximately __50 percent of women had left their jobs in STEM fields—mostly in computing or engineering (Glass, Sassler, Levitte & Michelmore, 2013)__. As Figure 1.6 indicates, only about 20 percent of women working in other non-STEM professional occupations left their fields during the 30-year span covered by the study. __Women in STEM also were more likely to leave in the first few years of their career than women in non-STEM professions__.[^6]

# Responsibility

<!--

# Those are the problems of the industry.

Ask yourself: do want to be treated as not a brilliant engineer because you have a work schedule?
Do you want your female coworker treated unrespectfully on a conference? 
Do you want your data downloadable in a public telegram channel?
