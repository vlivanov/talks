# First steps

* Getting to know the organization and key people
* Getting to know the business and it's goals
* Build trust

---

# Requirements gathering

* Functional
* Non-functional
* Constraints

---

# Functional requirements!

* The system should allow an administrator to login
* The system should show the list of users

---

# Non-functional requirements

* The application should use TLS 1.2 for all connections involving user-data
* The application should open the page under 0.5 second
* The application may not be available 1 hour per year 

--- 

# Constraints

* The app should be deployed to customers' Azure cloud
* The app should implement 152 federal law
* The app should be developed with Xamarin technology

---

# Some of them will change the architecture of the solution.

---

# Every additional 9 of availability doubles the complexity of a target system.

---

---

# Source of requirements

* Stakeholders

---

Stakeholders are the people who have an interest in the project

* Customer business representatives
* Delivery organization business representatives
* Technical folks from both sides
* End-users
* Competitors

---

## In order to gather requirements you need to talk to stakeholders. 

## The stakeholders identification is one of the main responsibilities of a Solution Architect.

# Whatâ€™s an architecture? 

The set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both. [^2]

# What the hell it means? 

* Architecture is a key to the system properties, an end user is concerned about
* Or product owner thinks so
* There are no bad or good architectures; there are ones that fit the target system properties

---

# ASRs

## Target system properties which affects architecture are unsurprisingly called architecturally significant requirements.  

---

---

# How to identify ASR? 

* From requirements documents
* By interviewing stakeholders
* By understanding the business goals
* Utility tree!

# How to document architecture? 

* Non-formal notations with general purpose diagramming
* Semi-formal notations with standardized notation
* Formal notations with precise semantics

# Documenting the architecture is the third most important activity for an SA.

---

![center](project.png)

---

# Construction

* Bootstrap the development
* Define and setup quality gates
* Create PoCs 
* Share knowledge

---

![center](project.png)

---

# Transition

* To production
* To other team

---

# So...

The person who identifies stakeholders, gathers ASRs, builds the architecture, shares it and bootstraps some of the systems components is usually called Solution Architect.
